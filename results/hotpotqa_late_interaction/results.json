Most of the city is located on the Taipei Basin, an ancient lakebed bounded by the two relatively narrow valleys of the Keelung and Xindian rivers, which join to form the Tamsui River along the city's western border.  Formerly known as Taipeh-fu during the Qing era and Taihoku under Japanese rule, Taipei became the capital of Taiwan Province as part of the Republic of China in 1945 and has been the capital of the ROC since 1949, when the Kuomintang lost the mainland to the Communists in the Chinese Civil War."

        "prompt": "Answer the question concisely using the evidence. Cite the key fact.\nEvidence:\nXylobands are wristbands that contain light-emitting diodes and radio frequency receivers.  The lights inside the wristband can be controlled by a software program, which sends signals to the wristband, instructing it to light up or blink, for example.  The RGB version has a white strap and can emit any colour on the spectrum.  The single colour version is available in green, blue, yellow, red, pink and white.  The first use of Xylobands on a large scale was on Coldplay's 2012 Mylo Xyloto tour.  A Xyloband was given to each member of the audience, and as the concert played, the flashing of the bands was synchronized to the music.  The inventor of the wristbands, Jason Regler, stated that he had the idea for the flashing wristbands while at a Coldplay concert, during the song \"Fix You\".\n\n\"Ask\" is a song recorded by the English rock band the Smiths.  It was released as a single on 20 October 1986 through Rough Trade Records.  Credited to vocalist Morrissey and guitarist Johnny Marr, \"Ask\" is an upbeat, positive pop song built around major chords.  Its lyrics touch on shyness and encourages the listener to release their inhibitions.  Its multiple guitar parts and complex production led to disagreements regarding its final mix.  In addition, Craig Gannon, one-time rhythm guitarist for the group, has claimed he wrote and was denied credit for the song's chord structure.\n\n\"Talk Dirty\" is a song by American singer Jason Derulo, released as the second single from his third studio album, \"Tattoos\" (2013), in Europe and Oceania.  Derulo's third studio album was retitled \"Talk Dirty\" for its US release, featuring an alternative track listing.  It was released as the third single in the US on January 7, 2014.  Additional vocals are provided by American rapper 2 Chainz, making it Derulo's first single to feature a guest performer, excluding the French version of \"Whatcha Say\".  The artists co-wrote the song with Jason Evigan, Sean Douglas, Ori Kaplan, Tamir Muskat, Tomer Yosef, and Wallpaper frontman Ricky Reed; the latter is also the song's producer.  The song is built around sampled instrumentals from \"Hermetico\" by the Israeli band Balkan Beat Box from their 2007 studio album \"Nu Med\".  The main saxophone lick is based on characteristic Turkish traditional ornamentations, particularly rendering the Turkish wind instrument Zurna.\n\nQuestion:  Jason Regler, stated that he had the idea for the flashing wristbands during a song built around which instrument ?\nAnswer:",

Cite the key fact.\nEvidence:\nThe Tugurt language, also known as Oued Righ Berber and Temacine Tamazight, is a Zenati Berber variety spoken in some of the oases of the northeastern Oued Righ region around Touggourt in Algeria.  s of 1893 , its main speech area was in Temacine, Blidet-Amor, Meggarine and Ghomra.  It is closely related to the nearby Tumzabt (Mozabite) and Teggargrent (Ouargli) languages.\n\nThe Berber languages, also known as Berber or the Amazigh languages (Berber name: \"Tamazi\u0263t\", \"Tamazight\"; Neo-Tifinagh: \u2d5c\u2d30\u2d4e\u2d30\u2d63\u2d49\u2d56\u2d5c, Tuareg Tifinagh: \u2d5c\u2d30\u2d4e\u2d30\u2d63\u2d49\u2d57\u2d5c, \u2d5d\u2d30\u2d4e\u2d30\u2d63\u2d49\u2d57\u2d5d , ] , ] ), are a family of similar and closely related languages and dialects spoken by the Berbers indigenous to North Africa.  The Berber languages constitute a branch of the Afroasiatic family.  They were traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script, which now exists in the form of Tifinagh.\n\nBerber orthography is the writing system(s) used to transcribe the Berber languages.  In antiquity, the Libyco-Berber script (Tifinagh) was utilized to write Berber.  Early uses of the script have been found on rock art and in various sepulchres.  Following the spread of Islam, some Berber scholars also utilized the Arabic script.  There are now three writing systems in use for Berber languages: Tifinagh (Libyco-Berber), the Arabic script, and the Berber Latin alphabet.  Different groups in North Africa have different preferences of writing system, often motivated by ideology and politics.\n\nQuestion: What language, traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script, is closely related to the Tumzabt and Teggargrent languages?\nAnswer:",

Through its three divisions, it offers a wide variety of liberal arts and science courses at the secondary, British A-level, and United States junior college levels.  St. John's College is a Roman Catholic institution in the Jesuit tradition, one of the oldest, largest, and most diverse educational institutions in Belize, founded by the Jesuits in 1887.\n\nSt. John's College High School is a high school for boys situated in Belize City, Belize.  It was founded in 1887.  The High School exists to educate academically talented young men in a Jesuit environment of self-discipline, love of learning, and service to others.  The school 's curriculum is complemented by sports and extracurricular activities.  The third and fourth form classes follow the Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate (CSEC) curricula and sit the regionally administered examinations at the end of their fourth year.\n\nThe list of St. John's Seminary (California) people is a compilation of lists of notable alumni, faculty, and current students of St. John's Seminary in Camarillo, California, United States.  St. John's Seminary grants graduate degrees for seminarians preparing for the priesthood, as well as a graduate degree for lay persons interested in pastoral ministry.  The St. John's Seminary College was the undergraduate division of the seminary before it closed in the early 21st century.  The table of notable alumni lists the date of graduation from St. John's college, seminary, or both, if applicable.

He is a successful doubles player with three Grand Slam championships and an Olympic silver medal, and has also had success in singles, winning five career titles and gaining victories over Novak Djokovic, Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych, Robin S\u00f6derling, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Nikolay Davydenko, Janko Tipsarevi\u0107 and John Isner.  Llodra has been called \"the best volleyer on tour\".\n\nJuan Mart\u00edn del Potro was the defending champion, but chose not to participate this year, after undergoing a wrist operation in May and only starting to practice again in August.  Del Potro was the third man in the Open Era not to defend his US Open title, after Ken Rosewall in 1971 (due to conflicts between the World Championship Tennis (WCT) and the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF)), and Pete Sampras in 2003 (who unofficially retired after the 2002 final).  For the first time in U.S. Open history, no American player was seeded in the top 8, this was reflected in the result.\n\nJuan Mart\u00edn del Potro (] , born 23 September 1988), also known as Delpo is an Argentinian professional tennis player who is currently ranked world No. 24 in men's singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP).  His biggest achievement has been winning the 2009 US Open, defeating Rafael Nadal in the semifinal and 5-time defending champion Roger Federer in the final.  He was the first to defeat both Federer and Nadal during the same major and was the only man outside the Big Four to win a major between the 2005 French Open and the 2013 US Open, a span of 35 tournaments.  He is also the second Argentine and the fifth-youngest man to win the US Open in the Open Era.  Other career highlights include winning the bronze medal in men's singles at the 2012 London Olympics and the silver medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics and being part of his country's successful Davis Cup team; but his career has also been hampered by a succession of wrist injuries.\n\nQuestion: Micha\u00ebl Llodra of France, called \"the best volleyer on tour\", defeated Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro a professional of what nationality?\nAnswer:",

It appeared in the Broadway show \"Sweet and Low\" starring James Barton, Fannie Brice and George Jessel.  The song was published in 1930 by Remick Music Corporation.  The song has become a pop standard, recorded by many artists including Rudy Vallee in 1931, Annette Hanshaw in 1931 , and Bing Crosby.  It plays in the 1939 Porky Pig cartoon \"Naughty Neighbors\" and the 1942 Daffy Duck cartoon \"The Daffy Duckaroo\".  Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong recorded the song for Decca in 1951, accompanied by the Dave Barbour Orchestra.  It was later included on Ella's Decca album \"Ella and Her Fellas\".\n\n\"Heebie Jeebies\" is a composition written by Boyd Atkins which achieved fame when it was recorded by Louis Armstrong in 1926.  The recording on Okeh Records by Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five includes a famous example of scat singing by Armstrong.\n\nThe Louis Armstrong Hot Five and Hot Seven Sessions were recorded between 1925 and 1928 by Louis Armstrong with his Hot Five and Hot Seven groups.  According to the National Recording Registry, \"Louis Armstrong was jazz's first great soloist and is among American music's most important and influential figures.  These sessions, his solos in particular, set a standard musicians still strive to equal in their beauty and innovation.\"  These recordings were added to the National Recording Registry in 2002, the first year of the institution's existence.\n\nQuestion: What is the middle name of the singer who recorded Would You Like to Take a Walk? with Louis Armstrong in 1951\nAnswer:",

Cite the key fact.\nEvidence:\nSporobolus is a nearly cosmopolitan genus of plants in the grass family.\n\nZea perennis, the perennial teosinte, is a true grass species in the genus \"Zea\" and a teosinte.  It is one of the two perennial species in the genus \"Zea\".  The other perennial, \"Z. diploperennis,\" is the sister taxon of \"Z. perennis\".  Those two species also form a clade with \"Z. luxurians\".  Together, the three species make up the \"Luxuriantes\" section in the genus \"Zea\".  \"Z. perennis\" is the sole tetraploid in the genus and fertile hybrids with diploid \"Zea\" species are rare.  Ribosomal ITS evidence suggested introgression between \"Z. perennis\" and \"Z. mays\" that must have come from either crossing the ploidy barrier or been from the diploid ancestral pool.  \"Z. perennis\" is generally considered to be an autotetraploid from some ancestral population of \"Z. diploperennis\".\n\nZea is a genus of plants in the grass family.  The best-known species is \"Z. mays\", variously called maize, corn, or Indian corn, one of the most important crops for human societies over much of the world.

Cite the key fact.\nEvidence:\nDoyle's Cafe is a bar / restaurant located on Washington Street in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts.  Doyle's Cafe was established in 1882 and is located near the Samuel Adams Brewery.  Its close proximity to the Samuel Adams Brewery affords Doyle's the unique opportunity to serve new or experimental Samuel Adams beers.  It is also where Samuel Adams Boston Lager was first put on tap.  Throughout its history, Doyle's has been known as a favorite watering hole for both local and national politicians.  On St. Patrick's Day in 1988, Senator Ted Kennedy helped dedicate a new room at the location to his maternal grandfather, John F. Fitzgerald.\n\nThe Kennedy Compound consists of three houses on six acres (24,000 m\u00b2) of waterfront property on Cape Cod along Nantucket Sound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, United States.  It was once the home of American businessman and political figure Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., his wife Rose, and two of their sons, President John F. Kennedy and Senator Robert F. Kennedy.  Their youngest son, Senator Ted Kennedy, lived in his parents' house, and it was his main residence from 1982 to 2009.  He died of brain cancer at the compound in August 2009.\n\nPatrick Kennedy (February 16, 1823 \u2013 November 22, 1858) was an Irish farmer, businessman, and politician who moved to East Boston, Massachusetts from County Wexford, Ireland.  He was born in New Ross, Ireland.  He was the father of businessman/politician P. J. Kennedy, paternal grandfather of businessman/politician Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., and patrilineal great-grandfather of World War II casualty Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and longtime Senator Ted Kennedy.\n\nQuestion: When did Senator Ted Kennedy helped dedicate a new room at the location to his maternal grandfather, John F. Fitzgerald.\nAnswer:",

The group was formed at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia in 1987 by Toby McKeehan, Michael Tait, and Kevin Max Smith.  They released five major studio albums together: \"DC Talk\" (1989), \"Nu Thang\" (1990), \"Free at Last\" (1992), \"Jesus Freak\" (1995), and \"Supernatural\" (1998).  In 2002, the \"Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music\" called DC Talk \"the most popular overtly Christian act of all time.\"\n\nThe Katinas are a contemporary Christian music group.  They are a family of five brothers.  The group's members sang in Assembly of God church as children, and began playing fairs, soon moving up to nationwide slots opening for R. Kelly, Jasmine Guy, DC Talk, and Amy Grant.  The group was signed to Gotee Records and have released several albums on the imprint, including a 2006 retrospective entitled \"Collection\".  Shortly after their 2006 \"Collection\" Release, their contract with Gotee expired.  It was not renewed, and they are no longer signed to a label.  Their album \"Still\" was independently released in August 2008.  They recently performed at UCLA in 2009 from June 30 \u2013 July 2 for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and played in the Harvest Crusade of 2008, 2009, and 2013.\n\nKevin Max (born August 17, 1967) is an American singer, songwriter, and poet.  He is best known for being a member of the Christian pop group DC Talk.  As a solo artist following the 2001 dissolution of DC Talk, he has recorded eight full-length studio albums, one Christmas album, and seven EPs, with one releasing in July.  From 2012 until 2014, he was the lead singer of the band Audio Adrenaline.\n\nQuestion: Which music group has the most members, DC Talk, or Manchester Orchestra?\nAnswer:",

The rebellion was set off by enactment under President Plutarco El\u00edas Calles of a statute to enforce the anti-clerical articles of the Mexican Constitution of 1917 (also known as the Calles Law).

UNCF is headquartered at 1805 7th Street, NW in Washington, D.C.  In 2005, UNCF supported approximately 65,000 students at over 900 colleges and universities with approximately $113 million in grants and scholarships.  About 60% of these students are the first in their families to attend college, and 62% have annual family incomes of less than $25,000.
